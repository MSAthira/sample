initial commit, log, log,git checkout, status 

for new project --'init' used

creted a new project in destop

init inside project _sam so a .git folder is made .it means it is hidden folder
to create a file it is used "" touch command"
touch hello.html

in windows it is echo. hello.html( where hellom is the file name )

 git add "file name" --> will add an file to git nad when checking it shows green color
git status --> gives the status of the folder

 to commit a file in to the git we need todo:
git commit -m "my initial git line of initialisation" [git commit -m "message"]

"git log "to see the commit id
to go from one commit id to other commit id :
"git checkout <copy paste the id >"

git --add all Or git add .
 will add all files 

branch , merge 

1. we can commit only 2 files out of 4 file for indexing or cahce. in adding .
because if 4 files have chages and 2 files need to edit in diffente area so, 2 files can add..> when commiting only this file is commited others are untracked
extention of each file neeed to be given, so it will be good when coding.


"init" can be done in as many directories, it is only for that folder(directory) it will only work withn that directory
 user global setting --Config is used once so it is used once in your system 
  first add file to git, then commit it , then see the log and see the status of your commits


<<<<<<< HEAD
git branching

git branch create a new branch 
it is like this

git branch feature



why branch created ??
if something is added or changed in that branch only get the chnage.

the master stay there itself , all the other branches and "head will be moving "

in that case we can add multiple branches

>>>>>>> master
